## Cyclic linked list question

1) Given a cyclic linked list (or circular buffer):
- write out how you would go about inserting a new node, given an int and starting Node


Node Example:
```js
function Node (int) {
  this.value = int
  this.next = null
}
```

cyclic linked list example:

3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 13 -> 20
